Here is a quick converted version of beep scripts for BSD. Personally, I use it for my PFSense router. Quality varies, I figured I could at least upload what I have and hopefully someone would enjoy it/make it better.

Collection of `beep` scripts to play music from pc speaker.

Where possible, the source is documented as a comment in each individual file.
